The network was set to forecast the next-day trade direction signal of several pre-selected stocks –the pool of low-beta stocks. The idea of employing an ANN signal generation model, was to add a second layer of improvement on the already over-performing stocks as implied by the market anomaly and the underlying factor strategy. The network successfully detects buy signals allowing to “hand-pick” several stocks from an already well-performing pool of stocks. My ANN-based investment strategy systematically achieves portfolio gains (as captured by increases in risk-adjusted returns) over the benchmarks. In particularly, over the period 2009-2017, my algorithmic strategy on average increases the Sharpe ratios by 65% and triples the FF5-alphas compared to the standard overperforming low-beta factor decile portfolios (P1-P3). My best performing ANN portfolio (comprised of the 330 lowest-beta US stocks, before “hand-picked” by the network) achieves a 126% increase, resulting a Sharpe ratio of 5, translating to a ratio of 7.7 relative to the Sharpe of the S\u0026amp;P500 with dividends reinvested.\n","date":1562716800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562716800,"objectID":"fa3e0b19fa7f606b774b3494175d7c99","permalink":"https://ckarag.github.io/project/ann_bab/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ann_bab/","section":"project","summary":"Employing an ANN trade-direction signal generator to boost the realized returns obtained from the decile portfolios of the beta anomaly in the US equities market.","tags":["Machine Learning","Alpha"],"title":"A Trade-signal Generator for Improving Portfolio Returns of Factor Strategies","type":"project"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
