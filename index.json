The idea of employing an ANN signal generation model, was to add a second layer of improvement on the already over-performing stocks as implied by the market anomaly and the underlying factor strategy. The network successfully detects buy signals allowing to ‚Äúhand-pick‚Äù several stocks from an already well-performing pool of stocks. My ANN-based investment strategy systematically achieves portfolio gains (as captured by increases in risk-adjusted returns) over the benchmarks. In particularly, over the period 2009-2017, my algorithmic strategy on average increases the Sharpe ratios by 65% and triples the FF5-alphas compared to the standard overperforming low-beta factor decile portfolios (P1-P3). My best performing ANN portfolio (comprised of the 330 lowest-beta US stocks, before ‚Äúhand-picked‚Äù by the network) achieves a 126% increase, resulting a Sharpe ratio of 5, translating to a ratio of 7.7 relative to the Sharpe of the S\u0026amp;P500 with dividends reinvested.\n","date":1562716800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562716800,"objectID":"fa3e0b19fa7f606b774b3494175d7c99","permalink":"https://ckarag.github.io/project/ann_bab/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ann_bab/","section":"project","summary":"Employing an ANN trade-direction signal generator to boost the realized returns obtained from the decile portfolios of the beta anomaly in the US equities market.","tags":["Machine Learning","Alpha"],"title":"A Trade-signal Generator for Improving Portfolio Returns of Factor Strategies","type":"project"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.

In the two plots at the top, all the simplifications made in the course are dropped.\nThe dataset is made of 160 carefully selected mixed-frequency indicators, that are updated on a timely basis (i.e. every time the nowcasts are re-run). As such, the nowcasts reflect the information contained in the latest released economic and market data, as of the day of the estimation (which can be seen by hovering over the corresponding points in the plots).

The model comparison is based on a set of (pseudo) real-time vintages, formed using a rich standardized set of variables at mixed-frequencies.\nThe performance evaluation currently covers US real GDP growth rate (QoQ%), comparing 20 distinct methodologies (including 14 Machine Learning algorithms, as well as standard econometric techniques and workhorse benchmarks), which are combined with three data transformations (D1,D2,D3) for taking into account the mixed-frequency dimension. This results into a ranking containing a total of 85 specifications.\nDataset The dataset consists of 87 quarterly, and 171 monthly (including 32 financial market) indicators. The indicators correspond to the series found in the FRED-MD and -QD datasets and were downloaded at their original (i.e. highest-available) sampling frequency, whenever possible. Publication release delays were inferred from the metadata in the FRED database (https://fred.stlouisfed.org) and then applied to each series to mimic the ragged-edge structure the forecaster would face in reality. The out-of-sample evaluation exercise uses end-of-month vintages at a monthly periodicity, assuming that economic activity is monitored in real-time by updating the projections at the end of every month.\nA list of the indicators that compose the mixed-frequency dataset, can be accessed here. ‚ÄòSeriesID‚Äô refers to the FRED mnemonic, while the release delay (‚ÄòRDelay‚Äô) measures the approximate number of days it takes for the respective indicator to be released after the closing of the reference month or quarter. The monthly mixed-frequency vintages used in the POOS model evaluation can be downloaded here. The full set consists of 376 end-of-month vintages spanning the period 19900131-20210430, including monthly and quarterly unbalanced panels whose ragged edge has been imposed by applying the inferred publication delays.\nList of forecasting models Acronym Model Description AR(P) Autoregressive iterated-specification RW Random walk ARDI(K,BIC) Autoregressive diffusion indices with K factors.
